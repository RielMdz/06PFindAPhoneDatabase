# 06PFindAPhoneDatabase
Project Description
The database that we use in the program was retrieved from Kaggle.com. In order to run the program, the user must have a modern computer. The software will find what specification of mobile phone the user wants. The user will be able to see the relation of the features and the price range of the mobile phone. In running the program, the user can specify the features they want, like megapixels of the front and back camera, how much memory, RAM, internal memory, battery power, etc. Basically, the software will classify the mobile price based on the exact specification the user wants.
